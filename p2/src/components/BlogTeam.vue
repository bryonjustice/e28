            <h3>ABOUT</h3>
            <p>Few characters in history can be more poloarizing than Napoleon Bonaparte.
                To some he is a fascinating national hero, a military genius, statesman, 
                reformer.  The embodiment of history's 'Great' men theory. <br/><br/>
                To others the 'Corsican Fiend' was a despised monster, a war obsessed tyrant 
                and cruel despot.<br/><br/>
                This blog's purpose is to create an interest in early nineteenth century European
                history and to reevaluate the complexity of Napoleon's legacy by revisting the
                events of his life in a first person blog form so that we may strip away historical
                bias and potentially see him as a singular man.  <br/><br/>
