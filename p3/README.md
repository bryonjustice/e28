## How is authentication being used in your application?

- PostAddPage (add a post page)\
  The primary page to create content by posting a blog requires authorization.
  Authorization is enforced both via Vue Router navigation guards (reference `\common\router.js` and identify the route `path: '/post/new',` which includes the `requiresAuth: true` meta data)  
  and by the available API permission level on the `post` resource. The resource permission level has been set to level 1 permitting the resource readable by all site visitors, but only alterable by registered users.

## What data entities of your application are being managed via Vuex?

- The blogs `posts` data is managed via Vuex (reference `\common\store.js`
